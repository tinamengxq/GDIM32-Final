## Check-In
### Devlog Questions

#### Personal Devlog:
1. What did you contribute to the project at this stage? 
2. Also, reflect on how useful your Proposal and break-down (from the W7 activity) has been so far to actually building your project.
#### Team Devlog:
1. Prompt A:

Describe how you used one of the tools that we learned in Week 6- Gizmos, the Unity profiler, breakpoints, or version control techniques- to solve a technical issue with your project. Make sure to clearly describe what the problem was; why you picked the tool that you chose; and how you diagnosed and solved the issue.
2. Prompt B:

Describe how intermediate-level vector math is being used in your project. This could be any of following the vector topics we talked about in Weeks 7-8: dot products, surface normals, coordinate space transformations, or raycasting (or sphere-casting, box-casting, etc). Make sure to clearly describe the feature that required this math; what concept you used and why it's relevant; and how the code works.
